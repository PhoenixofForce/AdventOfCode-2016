# AdventOfCode-2016
My solutions for the [advent of code 2016](https://adventofcode.com/2016) written in c++

## Setup
Create an additional folder named `2016inputs`. In there you can create files `dayXX.txt` where XX denotes the day you want to have solved with leading 0s (XX comes from {01, 02, 03, ..., 22, 23, 24, 25}). In this file you paste your Puzzle Input from the AOC-Website.
Then adjust the first value in the Makefile. Afterwards `make`(or similar command) the project in the commandline.
